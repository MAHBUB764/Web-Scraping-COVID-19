# Web-Scraping-COVID-19

>> This this the link where I found the data set.{https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/}
 The script collects data such as total cases, total deaths, total tests, total recovered, and population for various countries and stores it in a list. It then converts the list into a pandas DataFrame and exports it as both an Excel file ('COUNTRY_DATA.xlsx') and a CSV file ('COUNTRY_DATA.csv').

This data could be valuable for various analyses and insights. For example, you can use this data to:

1. Analyze the spread and impact of COVID-19 across different countries based on the total cases and total deaths.
2. Calculate the recovery rates and mortality rates for different countries.
3. Compare countries based on their testing rates and population to assess the testing coverage and infection rates.
4. Perform trend analysis over time by collecting this data periodically and comparing the changes in total cases, deaths, and recoveries.

Overall, this data extraction and manipulation process can provide valuable insights into the global impact and response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
